 * ============================================================================
 *  WHAT IS A WORKFLOW? (read this first — teaching file)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  A *subagent* is a single delegated task: Claude hands off one job, the
 *  agent runs in its own context window, and returns one result. The
 *  orchestration — deciding what to spawn next — lives in Claude's head.
 *
 *  A *workflow* writes that orchestration down as CODE. It's a JavaScript
 *  script that spawns MANY agents with real control flow: loops, conditionals,
 *  fan-out, and pipelines. It runs deterministically in the background and
 *  hands back a single result. Reach for one when the work is too big for a
 *  single context window, or needs verification you can't trust freehand.
 *
 *  WHEN TO USE A WORKFLOW (not for everyday coding):
 *    - Broad audits      — "check every component for X" across many files
 *    - Migrations        — one transform-agent per call site
 *    - Multi-source research — fan out searches, then verify + synthesize
 *    - Design exploration   — N approaches, judged, best one synthesized
 *    - High-stakes review   — adversarially verify before acting
 *  For "fix this bug" or "add this section", just use one agent. A workflow
 *  there is over-engineering.
 *
 *  THE PRIMITIVES the workflow runtime gives you:
 *    - agent(prompt, opts)        — spawn one subagent (opts.schema => structured output)
 *    - parallel([thunks])         — run many at once, wait for ALL (a barrier)
 *    - pipeline(items, ...stages) — flow each item through stages, NO barrier
 *    - log() / phase()            — progress output and grouping
 *    - loops + budget             — dynamic: agent count computed at runtime
 *  NOTE: quality patterns like "adversarial verify" are NOT automatic — they
 *  are something the SCRIPT AUTHOR encodes. The power is that the primitives
 *  make those patterns cheap to write. A workflow is only as rigorous as its
 *  script. (This one encodes adversarial verify in Stage 2 below.)
 *
 *  HOW WORKFLOWS ARE INVOKED (they are OPT-IN — never auto-launched, because
 *  they can spawn dozens of agents and cost real tokens):
 *    - Ask in plain words: "run the verdant-design-audit workflow"
 *    - Say the keyword `ultracode` to opt into orchestration for the turn
 *    - Files in THIS folder (.claude/workflows/) are auto-registered as named
 *      workflows — a real, Claude-recognized directory (sibling to
 *      .claude/agents/ and .claude/skills/), not a made-up path.
 *    - Run `/workflows` to watch the live progress tree while one executes.
 *
 *  WHAT THIS WORKFLOW DOES & WHY YOU'D USE IT:
 *    A design-system audit of the Verdant marketing site. It fans out one
 *    reviewer per component (Stage 1), then pipes every finding to a SKEPTIC
 *    agent that tries to refute it (Stage 2), keeping only findings that
 *    survive. You'd use it to catch hardcoded colors / off-scale spacing /
 *    one-off shadows across all of app/ at once — work that's too broad for a
 *    single reviewer, and where adversarial verification filters out the
 *    plausible-but-wrong findings a lone reviewer would happily report.
